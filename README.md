# Laptop_Sales_Analysis
## Project Overview
In this project, I will conduct a comprehensive analysis of sales data for various personal computers. The analysis will include segmentation based on brands and types, utilizing a variety of statistical tools to derive valuable insights.

### Objectives:
- Perform an initial data analysis to understand the sales trends and patterns.
- Segment the data by brands and types of computers to identify key differences.
- Develop a special metric reflecting the value of computers based on the average ratings received from consumers and their prices.

This project is built on an existing dataset sourced from Kaggle, which provides a rich foundation for the analysis. The insights derived from this project aim to inform better decision-making for consumers and businesses alike in the competitive PC market.
